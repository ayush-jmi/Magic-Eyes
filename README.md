Using 8x8 LED matrix without using MAX7219
I wanted to make a project using 8x8 LED matrix without the help of MAX7219 and without adding any of the libraries.

So, I created Magic Eyes - a fun project which act as kind of humans. When something comes very close to us, our eyes closes on its on because of stimuli. I have done the same thing with my project.

I wanted it to be different, cheap and playful. If you use Max7219 circuit with it, it will be cost you around {2*(AU $5.54)}, while if you use only led matrix, it will cost around {2*(AU $0.8)}. I don't want to add any libraries because from them, we can't understand the code.
